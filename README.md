## My process

 I research a tutorial about SCSS in Youtube by finishing this tutorial I use SASS Documentation. I google more like mixin for breakpoints media queries.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learn more about SCSS including the mixin, nesting, partials and variables I use media queries by mixin but to be honest I prefer media queries in pure css

### Continued development

I will add an animation if I have time  to study.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - This helped me to grasp the syntax of SCSS.
